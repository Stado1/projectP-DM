## How to use pid\_one\_drone.py

1. start by running the file by typing: "python3 pid\_one\_drone.py"

2. then in a text editor open the text file: "coordinates.txt"

3. in this text file the are 3 numbers: on line 1 it is the x coordinate, on line 2 it is the y coordinate and on line 3 it is the z coordinate.
If you change the value of any of these coordinates and then save the file the drone should fly to that position in the simulation.
